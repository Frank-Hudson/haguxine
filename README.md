# Introductiaryoatiaon

This is the repository for _Haguxine_ (hagɯʃinɛ); my made up (or constructed) language, also known as a "[conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conlang)".

Currently has no real purpose, other than making a nice language.

## ✨ WORLD BUILDING! ✨

The speakers of this language primarily reside in non-snowy tundra and forest areas, overshadowed by large mountains and leading out into large plains and cold savannahs.

Their main source of food is small-medium game animals, small poultry, and limited fruit and veg, primarily in the form of berries and roots.

They often keep either [cervine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cervine)- or canine-like animals that live in the surrounding areas as pets. Occasionally, someone will take a bird as a pet, but usually nothing more flamboyant than that.
